Google BigQuery is a data cloud warehouse that enables businesses to query and analyze large datasets in real time, including a tremendous amount of on-chain data. Combining Push Protocol and Google BigQuery, users can now get BigQuery's on-chain data served to them via notifications and text chat directly in their crypto wallets.
